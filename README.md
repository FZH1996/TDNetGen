# TDNetGen: An open-source, parametrizable, large-scale, combined, transmission and distribution test system
## Power Systems Laboratory, ETH ZÃ¼rich

Please check XYZ link to paper for more information.

### About
 
TDNetGen is an open-source MATLAB toolbox is presented to generate combined transmission and distribution network test models. These models can be used to analyze the interactions between transmission and multiple distribution systems in areas such as provision of ancillary services by active distribution grids, co-optimization of planning and operation, emergency control and protection schemes spanning over different voltage levels, analyzing combined market aspects, etc. The generated system can be customized based on various parameters selected by the user, including renewable energy penetration, size of final system, and more.

### Setup and use

1. Before using the toolbox, it is necessary to download Matpower from http://www.pserc.cornell.edu/matpower/

2. In the file 'parameters.m', change the parameter 'matpower_path' to direct to the downloaded matpower folder (absolute or relative path). This tool has been tested with Matpower 6.0, newer versions should be compatible but not tested

3. Change the other parameters in 'parameters.m' according to the system that you want to generate

4. Run 'main.m'

5. Find the T&D system exported in the desired format in the folder 'output_data' 


### System configuration

- Developed with Matlab 2015b and Matpower 6.0
